# Design Patterns / Structural: Adapter

<p>An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.

The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects. It's usually implemented once the application is designed.</p>

<p><b>Scenario:</b> We have a computer that only accepts an HDMI input and two monitors, one of which has an HDMI input and the other a VGA input. Create an adapter that transforms HDMI to VGA to make it possible to connect the old monitor to the computer.</p>
